# Install PulseAudio

The PulseAudio snap is available from the Ubuntu Store. It can be installed on
any system that supports snaps but is only recommended on
[Ubuntu Core](https://www.ubuntu.com/core) at the moment.

You can install the snap with the following command:

```
 $ snap install pulseaudio
 pulseaudio 8.0-3 from 'canonical' installed
```

Although the pulseaudio snap is available from other channels (candidate, beta,
edge), only the stable version should be used for production devices. The
meaning of the other channels is internal to the development team of the
pulseaudio snap.

All necessary plugs and slots will be automatically connected within the
installation process. You can verify this with:

```
$ snap interfaces pulseaudio
Slot                Plug
:network            pulseaudio
pulseaudio:service  pulseaudio:client
-                   pulseaudio:home

```

As maybe noted, we do not connect the home plug of the PulseAudio snap by default.
This is because normally you will use another snap to play audio through PulseAudio
and then PulseAudio itself does not need any access to something outside of its
snap as the playing snap will submits its audio data over network or memory based
transport. If you want to use the included parec or paplay utilities you have to
connect the home plug as otherwise both can only read/write data within the
PulseAudio snap and nowhere else. You can connect it via:

```
$ snap connect pulseaudio:home core
```

Now you have PulseAudio successfully installed.
